When I was in Iceland a few years ago, I got to visit a lot of beautiful locations.

One time, my dog crashed into my dest and it knocked over my computer on the floor. Of course, she didn't do that on purpose(it wasn't on purpose). It was an honest mistake. She was just playing. But I yelled at her quite harshly. She got really scared and hid in the bathroom for a while. I didn't mean to scare her like that. I just lost my temper. *snap at someone* But I still feel kind of bad about that.
