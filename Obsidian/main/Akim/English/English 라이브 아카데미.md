<# bring up / come up / say something about / generic💡얘기를 꺼내다, 얘기가 나오다, 뭐라고 하다 ⟪실시간강의요약⟫>
A : Whose idea was it to do 'Secret Santa' for this Christmas? 
B : Well, we were going either to play the board game or to have a singing session after lunch, but was it Larry? 
C : Yeah, Larry said something about those activities being too generic which I thought was the whole point. Because we've done that last time. 
B : Right, but then we got to talking about it again... was it you? Someone brought up the idea of giving each other's presents. 
C : Yeah, a few budgets came up. Someone even mentioned $100. But that was a bit much. Everyone agreed that $50 sounded the best.

<# 영어 대화 가이드 ⟪ 명절 증후군 극복하기 ⟫>
A: You good?
B: Yeah. Just tired.
A: Got the post-holiday blues, huh?
A: The post-holiday blues. It's when you have trouble getting back to your normal routine after a big holiday.
B: No. I know what it is, but it's not that. I said that I was just tired... 
A: It's OK. You don't have to pretend. It's actually very common.
B: I'm not pretending. I'm just tired after a long day at work and you..
A: There's nothing to be ashamed of. I have it too. It's supposed to hit the hardest around this time of the year, you know. After spending all that time with family and friends for Christmas and New Year's Day.
B: Look. It's not post-holiday blues or some..
A: You know what the best way is to deal with it? Start planning for the next holiday. Or better yet, plan for a trip.
B: OK. Now I'm depressed.
A: See? And that's perfectly normal.
B: No. I mean, I was fine up until I started having this conversation with you
A: Here. Let me show you a Youtube video I saw last night. It's about depression and how it usually gets worse around the holidays...
