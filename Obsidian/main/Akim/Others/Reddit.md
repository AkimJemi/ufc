I was a liaability to her when I shouldve been there to take care of her
got super wasted
I was a liability to her when I shouldve been there to take care of her.
disappointed in me

Now work on not doing it again and the problem will be resolved. There is always a sober one in every couple, as you get older you can take turns but in my case I don't drink, so she can have fun without worrying about anything because I'm there.
thats a little iffy
I would edit this to; Don’t say you “won’t do it again”. Say you’ll do your best to not do it again. People mess up, chances are OP will get more drunk than they mean to (lord knows I have). Saying it will never happen sets you up for failure. Just do your best and make a real effort for it not to happen. Sorry if I’m just arguing semantics.

Follow that up with thoughtfulness in your actions going forward.
