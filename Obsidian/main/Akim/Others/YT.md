<Why do you learn English>
I always wanted to know more 
I always wanted to try more
So learning English was such an organic path for me to take as somebody who was obessed with other world.
Learning  English was such a joy for me.
Every time I learn something, I feel like my world expanded a little bit more.
it made me so excited to communicate with people in English.
It brought me joy to learn different cultures, different lifestyles, or even values in life through English.
But it could also be tough and overwhelming.
I lost all my confidence in My English and what I had done.
I was so nervous just to talk, whether it's a small group or a big crowd, I felt my heart was pounding.
I thought my English was fine back in Japan.
but I was forced to face the lack of my English skills every single day, which made me tense more and talk less.
let myself faill over and over again.
I talked to a lot of teachers in the world.
Through the conversation with many teachers with different backgrounds, I feel like I was able to go back to first love to English: joy of knowing the world.
because no matter how many times I use the wrong words, or didn't make sense, they never judged me. 
They let me practice, faill and be vulnerable.
And more importantly, I have gained the patience and power to face a challenge anyway.
And because of that, I am able to expand my career here in Japan.
For me, learning English is not just learning a language. 
it is about learning more about the world.
learning more about myself.
it is about being humble.
it is about trying my best every single day to be the best version of myself.
If you ever want to learn English, but being scared of starting it, now, is the time.

What have you been up to?
Whose turn is it?
Whose fault is it?

How did it go?
How long do cats live?
How long have we known each other?
Am I pronoucing that right?
Am I not a part of this anymore?
Are any of you guys free tonight?
Aren't we a little old for this?
Is he a friend of yours?
Is that okay with you?
Wasn't that like a year ago?
Does she still have any feelings left for you?
Doesn't that concern you?
Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Have we met?
Has this ever happened to you?
Won't that take longer?
Can someone help me with this?
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
What are you doing here? Didn't you get my text?
